📘 Daily Coding Challenge – Java & DSA Practice

This repository contains my daily coding practice focused on Core Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

The objective of this project is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen DSA concepts, and prepare for technical interviews through consistent daily practice.

🚀 Current Topics Covered
🔢 Mathematical Programs

Factorial (Iterative & Recursive)

Fibonacci (Iterative & Recursive)

🔁 Array & Number Operations

Reverse a number

Reverse an array

🔍 Number Theory

Prime number check

Print prime numbers

🔤 String / Logical Problems

Palindrome (multiple approaches)

📌 Upcoming Additions (DSA Roadmap)

I will be adding structured DSA topics including:

✅ Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)

✅ Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)

✅ Recursion Problems

✅ Arrays & Strings (Advanced)

✅ Linked List

✅ Stack & Queue

✅ Trees & Binary Search Tree

✅ Graph Basics

✅ Time & Space Complexity Analysis
